# Review and Remembering 

*My journal files from earlier this semester, pre-Covid-19, are still located in my 'journal' repository on Github.*

- First things first, I had to re-program my journal.sh command because something happened to my scripts folder, probably when I had to re-route my original journal. This was a nice refresher. We'll see how it all works once I push to Git, but it seemed easy enough to create a new folder (scripts.2) to put a fresh journal.sh file into. My *cheat-sheet.txt* was invaluable for the next step, having to be reminded of the command *chmod +x (file name)* to give permission to execute. It was satisfying to see my re-working succeed (so far). 

- The last notes I have are from when we started using Voyant. They detail ways we can search for patterns in a corpus. After uploading a corpus into a tool like Voyant, we can analyze the text in detail. Mostly, this entails a **concordance**, or list of words in a corpus. For instance, in the corpus of *Walden* on Voyant, we see the most commonly occuring words are "like/man/house/pond/day." Not surprising. But we may also search for specific words and see their frequency in the text, as semantic patterns running through chapters or the book as a whole. Now *that* might produce some surprising results. 

- We can easily transfer this pattern searching to the command line. After navigating to my projects folder, which contains both the walden.txt file and the walden_in_chapters folder, I can type the command **grep**. The linked page lists most of the essential commands, usually a string of symbols including more specific commands for things like word count (command **wc**):

- My goal for my next journal update is to remember more about Jupyter notebook and python, and review the past modules on Github to re-orient myself.
