# Staying Motivated

I know I can finish this semester strong! Here's some cool things I learned this week: 

**Quick Definitions**: 
- *close reading*: identifies meaningful patterns in a text for the purpose of interpretation. Think: the way you're taught to read in an English class. 
- *hyperreading*: quickly read to locate relevant info. Think: the way you read a website.
- *machine/distant reading*: relies on power of computation, creating concordance from corpus of many texts. Think: practicing on Voyant.
- NEW: *metareading*: reading for meta-commentary on a text; making claims about a text as text, usually involving interpretive judgments. Think: "what's the best way to present Emily Dickinson's corpus to readers?"

    * FLUID TEXT: texts whose meaning can't be fully understood apart from their textual history
        - a literary work is not a fixed and stable object, but a perpetually ongoing project
        - what does comparing early manuscripts to later ones and considering the authorial intent behind revisions reveal about the work? 
        - Comparing different versions ("witnesses") of the Gettysburg Address and Emily Dickinson's poem, "Faith is a fine invention", reveals a careful attention to the deliberate use of language-- even minute, single word changes have the power to alter meaning through the whole body of text. They also reveal the real *work* behind our greatest literary works-- it's seldom as easy as putting thoughts perfectly to the page. "Perfection" is painstakingly created, not realized instantaneously.
