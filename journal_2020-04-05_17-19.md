##*Walden*: Fluid Text Edition
#Notes, Thoughts, and Questions

- Notes from the *Introduction* by Paul Schacht
    * Aside: I love the quote from Thoreau, included here: 

    “The true poem is not that which the public read. There is always a poem not printed on paper, coincident with the production of this, stereotyped in the poet’s life. It is what he has become through his work. Not how is the idea expressed in stone, or on canvas or paper, is the question, but how far it has obtained form and expression in the life of the artist. His true work will not stand in any prince’s gallery." (from *A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers*)

    Along with the short poem: "My life has been the poem I would have writ, / But I could not both live and utter it.”

    I'm taking another course this semester called "Philosophy of the Arts" which is interrelated to many of our discussions in this class. Thoreau's view on art and the artist, expressed above, is unusual: in PHIL-225, we typically focus on the expression innate in the work of art itself, with only minimal research on the background and influences of the artist. We've discussed the dissonance between artistic intention and interpretation, but never what Thoreau seems to be getting at above: a far more personal question of how the artist evolved with their work. We can observe an artist's oeuvre over their lifetime, however; we cannot see their "truest work" as it manifests itself in the artist's life over time. As a deeply introspective individual, it's unsurprising that Thoreau draws a connection between making art and the consequent change (or shift, or break) of our innermost self. Hopefully I can clarify these thoughts and connections enough in the next few days to write a blog post. Anyway, back to my notes: 
    
    * There are seven drafts of the *Walden* manuscript. 
        * After reconstructing the first edition (or version) of *Walden* by "sorting leaves based on size, color, marks, ink, and handwriting," the scholar Shanley identified six distinct stages in Thoreau's revision of *Walden*: 
        1. Version A: 1846-1847 (written at Walden Pond)
        2. Version B: 1848
        3. Version C: 1849
        4. Version D: Early 1852
        5. Version E: Late 1852-1853 (Thoreau added a lot of material around this time)
        6. Version F: Late 1853-1854
        7. Version G: Feb./March 1854: published version
    The nature of *Walden* changed drastically from the 1846 manuscript to the published version in 1854. It seems that Thoreau himself changed, too. Did he change as a result of revising *Walden*, or did *Walden* evolve in response to Thoreau? Sattlemeyer's article, "Re-Making Walden," which I'll talk about in another journal, concurs with the latter.
