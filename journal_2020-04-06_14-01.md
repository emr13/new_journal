I secretly (not so secretly) need to re-learn how to push my journal files to Git. I've been uploading them manually, which seems to work fine, but also feels like a major shortcut. So, I hope I can figure this out. 
- Update, five minutes later: I followed Amanda's video online, and I can see my issue is my confusing journal files. After I did 'git commit' in my terminal, I got this error message: "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again." As I'm typing this in VSCode, my GUI indicates the location of this journal file as: "Users > emmaraupp > Documents > journal > my journal file. The problem is, all of my journal files are now in a folder called new_journal, so I have to change this. I tried manually moving my .md journal file into the new_journal folder, but that didn't work. I think I'll have to look back through the old modules on Git to re-do the 'git pull' steps. For now, I'll keep posting my journals this way.
