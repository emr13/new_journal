It's hard for me to focus on schoolwork when my mind is so muddled. This isn't the first time I've dealt with this problem, but it's unexpected now, when there's seemingly so little on my plate. I'm worried about so many other silly things that I can't seem to concentrate long enough to write. Reading is still mindless enough, but writing requires more effort. I'll keep trying. At least I get to stay in my own apartment, because staying with my parents would ruin my productivity. There is no quiet in that house. But the quiet in my apartment, right now, is not very conducive to work either. It's frustrating. I want to sit and read a book for the fun of it but then I feel guilty for the schoolwork I'm neglecting. Re-establishing a daily routine is critical for me right now. I lost it a little bit last week but I won't slip. I won't worry about being perfect or saying everything just right, I'll meet the requirements and move on. My mind makes things more difficult than they really are. Let go. Just do it.
