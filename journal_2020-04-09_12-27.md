# Conceptualizing Textual Fluidity
## Any text can be read as a "fluid text"

- *Fluidity*: substance with no fixed shape, not settled or stable, likely or able to change, able to flow easily, smoothly elegant or graceful 

This is the definition of fluidity according to Dictionary.com. It's important that we understand literature as innately fluid-- there are first drafts, revisions, omissions, and additions to all our great novels, plays, poems, addresses, and other documents. We would have an easier time naming texts that are more static than others (e.g. Kerouac supposedly writing *On the Road* in a week) than naming every fluid text, because all texts essentially are. I bet there's even evidence of some revision, or multiple versions, of Kerouac's *On the Road*, despite the brevity of its conception. To me, another key point of understanding text as fluid is connected to the secondary definition of "fluidity" as "smoothly elegant or graceful"; the effortless narrative "motion" of our favorite books is most often achieved through major authorial efforts in editing and revision. It's rare when the first draft best expresses what the creator envisions. 

What's different about a fluid text edition? 
    Most importantly, we can see how the text changes over time. Fluid text editions should indicate sites of revision in the text as well as a *revision narrative*: usually the editor or a readers' best judgment as to what ends the revision was designed to meet. This invites other readers to propose their own interpretive revision narratives, too.
