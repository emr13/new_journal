# The Evolution of *Walden*
## Early Years
Notes from Sattlemeyer's article, "Remaking Walden":
- After spending time in the late 1840s at Walden Pond, Thoreau had two manuscripts for two books he planned on publishing. The first, which he published to little acclaim, was thereafter largely forgotten; the second was the first version of *Walden*. After the first book's failure, Thoreau continued working on *Walden* sporadically for the next five years. He used the rough material wrote during the years at Walden Pond in his lectures. 

- A quarrel with his mentor and fellow transcendentalist, Ralph Waldo Emerson, led Thoreau to re-assess the goals of transcendentalism himself. If humans were to make contact with divinity through nature, as transcendentalism proposed, Thoreau thought there could be a "new, detailed, and systematic approach to nature studies" expressed in his writing. Unlike his predecessors, he would attempt to provide concrete answers based on work with fieldworkers and natural historians. By grounding transcendentalism in a scientific, quanitifiable reality, Thoreau set himself apart. 

- Sattlemeyer mentions that for the rest of his life after living at Walden Pond, Thoreau made a habit of "morning pages and an afternoon trek" in the wilderness. This reminded me of how important daily habits are, and how much these small choices make a difference. Thoreau's habits create a near-perfect environment for revising *Walden*. I've heard of writing morning pages before, and someday hope to have that type of motivaton. Like Thoreau and any other great writer, I need to make a regular habit of writing, like exercising. Honestly, if I could write morning pages and go on a long daily walk like Thoreau (both of which I am very much capable of doing, if only I choose to), I would probably feel a lot better than I do now. This was a good inadvertent reminder to me that I am more in control of my life than I feel. 

- During this time in Thoreau's life, Sattlemeyer writes, he also switched to writing in a private journal, which "allowed him to replicate the sequentiality, randomness, and the endless iteration of nature, and to inscribe himself in the process." I like this, because it shows Thoreau's commitment to keeping the work his own; a scientific, but not impersonal account of the natural world.
