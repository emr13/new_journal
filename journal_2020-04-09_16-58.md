# The Evolution of *Walden*
## Later Years

- Earliest chapters of *Walden* were made for lecture, which the later chapters are more often the "product of years of observation and evolution in thought." We see this in Thoreau's daily habits in the years after Walden and his falling-out with Emerson. The second half of *Walden* is more introspective, meditative, and descriptive. Thoreau comes off as a scientist revealing both poetic and actual truths. His methodology as a naturalist emphasizes perception and individual observation. 

- Gradual realization of purpose: many additions/expansions of original text in later versions alter *Walden's* focus. For example, on page 186: "A lake is a landscape's most beautiful and expressive feature. It is earth's eye; looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his own nature." This was added in the sixth version of *Walden*, revealing Thoreau's inclination that the study of nature is synonymous with the study of self. 

- The ending of the first version of *Walden* was disappointing; at that time, Thoreau didn't fully realize what the experience signified in his life and his self, though he had an inkling of what it would mean for his contemporaries. Ultimately, Thoreau is sharing his experience at the pond, but the counterpoint to that is the subtle "indictment of American and particularly New England materialist values," which was fully fleshed out in later drafts. It took time and further experience for some of the best sections of *Walden* to be written. Sattlemeyer calls *Walden* an archetypal Romantic text like Walt Whitman's *Leaves of Grass", meaning it "developed as its author developed, preserving experience and re-interpreting it." 

- In his revisions, Thoreau added many allusions to other books, grounding his in a sort of research. This compounds Thoreau's narrative style as both immediate and retrospective, because he so often looks back to Ancient wisdom while traversing the present world, and also reveals his growth as a reader/thinker. Allusions to eastern philosophy in particular connect him to a wider human community, existing in both the past and present.
