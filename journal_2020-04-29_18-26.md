# Metalanguages 

A metalanguage is a specialized technical vocabulary used to denote physical parts of a text, such as "title" and "chapter #." One such metalanguage is the T.E.I., short for "Text Encoding Initiative." The T.E.I. defines itself as a "consortium which develops and maintains a standard for representation of text in digital forms." This means its main purpose is to make statements about a text: particularly its structure. To contrast, the main purpose of a metalanguage like HTML is formatting how a text appears on your browser screen. T.E.I. describes textual structure to computers. 

Textual structures tell us how we should think about the text and its meaning. For example, we read and think about a poem differently than we read and think about a novella. We know, based on the poem's distinctive structure, divided into lines, that it is a poem, and we should understand it as such. To digitally render a poem with the same structure as a novella would be misleading, and likely lead to misunderstandings of the poem as a whole. That's why it's important to use a consistent, precise metalanguage like T.E.I. when transferring texts to digital formats. 

Computers do not possess intuitive knowledge. When we're making a blog page or something, all we're doing is entering data into a computer. It needs some additional help to process this data, as well as help from metalanguages like HTML and T.E.I. to transform the content into a readable document online.
