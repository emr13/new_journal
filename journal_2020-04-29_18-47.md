# T.E.I. Tips

- Basic structure of a T.E.I. file: 
    1. XML declaration and comments
    2. < TEI >------< /TEI>
    3. Subparts: < teiHeader> and < text>
When making a T.E.I. file for a page of the *Walden* manuscript, we transcribe by line (< line>---</ line>) like so

**Elements and using the correct attributes matter for validation! Double check all elements are closed at the end!**
- Important Elements and their attributes
    - <msDesc: manuscript description (reminder that *Walden* is not a print-text in this form, but a source doc since it's a manuscript)
    - <gap reason= can be used to indicate illegible or unclear words
    - the element <del is for deletions. The attribute rend= indicates how the word was deleted by pairing it with a value like "strikethrough." 
    - the element <add is for additions. the attribute place= indicates where the word was added by pairing it with a value like "aboveline." Additionally, we can indicate whether the addition was made in pencil or ink with <handShift medium=. 
    - One element discovery I made on my own was for abbreviations. That's a little more complicated. First, you have to type < choice> followed by the element < expan> on either side of the full word or phrase. Following that, type < abbr> on either side of the abbreviation. Then, close the < choice> element. Validate to make sure you did it all correctly.
