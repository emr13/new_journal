# Working on the Final Project
So far, my biggest challenge for the final project was locating the manuscript images for the chapter we're working on. It seems like Thoreau's handwriting gets better in successive versions, so trying to find the first paragraph of "Visitors" in Version A (surprise, it's actually in "Solitude"!) took some time and squinting. But I must admit it is pretty cool to see Thoreau's process, from scribbles to finer script. The irony is that, for whatever reason, I still prefer taking handwritten notes to typing them, so I've been making my own scribbles about Thoreau's scribbles. Nice. 

I did eventually locate most of the images I need. I could not have done this without the Huntington Digital Library, the FTE of Walden, and the chapter files of Walden on VSCode. I had so many tabs open I thought my computer might combust, but as you said, it was quite doable. 

Not to be obnoxiously presumptuous, but, I actually think I found a mistake in the FTE of Walden. I'm sorry to bring this to your attention, and I definitely could be wrong. I hope I'm wrong for the sake of the data visualization page. Here's what I noticed: if you open the FTE of Walden and look at "Visitors", we see Version A ends on paragraph 13a. In Version B, if you scroll down to paragraph 14b, you'll see the section starting with "Sometimes there would come half a dozen rail road repairers..." and ending on the crossed out "civilization makes bright only the superficial film of the eye." The problem is, I found evidence of this passage in Version A.

Above are links to pages 161 and 163 from Version A. On the bottom of the first page, Thoreau is writing about the railroad men (and their clean Sunday shirts). On the second page, above the "I had three chairs" paragraph, I can make out the closing "men are wrecked by their consciousness, civilization makes bright only the superficial film of the eye." The problem is, the FTE indicates this passage was added in Version B. But, here it is in Version A. It doesn't make a huge difference, since Thoreau largely omits this passage later on anyway, but it doesn't make a lot of sense to imagine he added this long, messy paragraph in Version B just to edit it out. It was actually present in the original manuscript. My little rant is over.
