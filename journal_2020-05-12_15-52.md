# Final Project Reflections

I am happy with the way our project turned out. We weren't very collaborative, but we all seem to be solitary sort of people, so it worked out fine. Claire created the TEI file for page 163 of Version A, which falls in the area of what will become the chapter "Visitors." Originally, I chose this chapter because it was one of a few with detailed accounts of personal interactions with other people-- something most of us don't take for granted any more. After looking closely at "Visitors" the last few weeks, I don't think Thoreau took any human interactions for granted during his time at Walden Pond, either. Before I started the project, what I remembered most vividly from "Visitors" was that wise animal man, the Canadian woodchopper, Alex Therien, a.k.a Thoreau's true Homeric man. Truthfully, I was chasing an idea about homoeroticism in Thoreau's writing:

Here's a link to the abstract of a paper by Walter Harding on Thoreau's sexuality. Seems legit. I haven't read it, but the thought was intriguing. I feel like it's unethical to speculate about someone's sexuality, and there's no real evidence of Thoreau being sexually involved with anyone, male or female (remember "Higher Laws"?), but... Thoreau's description of Therien in Version A includes: 

- stout & sluggish, with a strong thick fleshy & sunburnt neck & dark bushy hair & dull sleepy & quiet blue eye
- strong-limbed, strong-bodied, etc.
- a well of good humor and contentment
- T "*loved* to sound him on all the reforms of the day" 
- the original conclusion of "Visitors" Version A is Therien, in response to Thoreau: "How I love to talk! By George, I could talk all day! *You make me think of things I never thought of before*" (likely just because Thoreau was a philosophical person, but still... how sweet. And how strange that Thoreau omitted this.)

Anyway, it's clear Thoreau genuinely enjoyed his prescence and admired something about him. It also became clear to me that this specific wasn't a great focus for the final project, but hey, the more you know, right? There were plenty of other interesting bits in "Visitors" to look at, which I'm sure the final project itself will sufficiently cover. For some reason, the line from "Visitors" that's stuck with me since this project is "A man sits as many risks as he runs." I'm sure it's stuck with me for a reason.
